# eulerprojectsolutions
These are my own personal solutions to the first 100 problems of ProjectEuler in Python. I am doing this as I am new to the site, and I wanted a new way to challenge myself :). If you happened to stumble upon this, feel free to take a look yourself. 

[ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a website full of practice problems for people who enjoy math and programming. Generally sharing solutions to the recent problems is frowned upon, but according to their FAQs the first 100 "archive problems" are exempt from this. 

Of course there are many ways to solve these problems. I am not claiming these are the definitive solutions, just the ones that make sense to me. Feel free to send make a pull request if you would like to make any corrections.
